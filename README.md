# mbed-CCS811
Driver for ScioSense CCS811 Air Quality Sensor for Mbed OS 6

ScioSense's driver is for Arduino only and not easy to port to other OS. Other Mbed drivers do not provide an option for temperature adjustment from an external sensor, which is needed for SparkFun SEN-14348 combo breakout.
